# NASA space app challenge 2023 - Immersed in the sound of space (F.E.S. team)

Our project aims to provide an auditory experience to silent videos, by adding sounds that realistically reflect each frame.

The videos can be watched on a webapp created by our team, through a player on the homepage. Such videos are a combination of images from the Hubble Telescope and the audio exctracted using our algorithm. The tool we developed could be the key to a full inclusive experience, by allowing for example visually impaired people to finally have a full and coherent perception of Space.

The algorithm only relies on the analysis of the main color palettes of each frame, which numeric values will then be used to obtain a frequency and the relative note. Through the use of libraries, said notes are then used to compose a song, then attached back to the video.

## Alpha
This project is just an alpha version developed for NASA SpaceAppsChallenge hackathon.
Frontend and backend haven't been linked, and the core doesn't use the object recognition script yet

Our future plans include the complete development of the entire application and the implementation of new features, such as the use of more layers/chords to the melody in order to make it sound more better and truthful.
